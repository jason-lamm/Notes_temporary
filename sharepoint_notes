Resolve distributed cache issue:

Verify the Distributed Cache service status:
a. Open the SharePoint Management Shell as an administrator.
b. Run the following command: Get-SPServiceInstance | ? {($_.service.tostring()) -eq "SPDistributedCacheService Name=AppFabricCachingService"} | select Server, Status
c. Check the status of the Distributed Cache service on each server in the farm.

Restart the Distributed Cache service:
a. Identify the server(s) with the problematic service.
b. Open the Services console (services.msc) on the server(s).
c. Locate the 'AppFabric Caching Service' and restart it.

Clear the cache:
a. Open the SharePoint Management Shell as an administrator.
b. Run the following command: Use-CacheCluster
c. Run the command: Clear-SPDistributedCacheItem -ContainerType DistributedLogonTokenCache
d. Clear other cache containers, if necessary, by replacing the DistributedLogonTokenCache in the command above with the relevant container name.

Reconfigure the Distributed Cache service:
a. Open the SharePoint Management Shell as an administrator.
b. Run the following command to remove the Distributed Cache service instance: Remove-SPDistributedCacheServiceInstance
c. Run the command to add a new Distributed Cache service instance: Add-SPDistributedCacheServiceInstance
d. Verify the new instance by running the command from step 1.

Check the AppFabric configuration:
a. Open the AppFabric configuration file (DistributedCacheService.exe.config) located in the 'C:\Program Files\AppFabric 1.1 for Windows Server' folder.
b. Verify that the configuration settings are correct, especially the connection string, cache size, and cache host settings.

Monitor event logs and ULS logs:
a. Check the Windows Event Viewer for AppFabric and SharePoint-related errors.
b. Review SharePoint ULS logs for any distributed cache-related issues. You can use tools like the 'ULS Viewer' to help with this.

Check the network and firewall settings:
a. Ensure that the appropriate ports are open and that there are no network-related issues affecting communication between the servers in the SharePoint farm.

Verify cache host version compatibility:
a. Make sure all servers in the SharePoint farm are running the same version of AppFabric and that it is compatible with your SharePoint version.

Consider reaching out to Microsoft Support or a SharePoint expert if the issue persists.
